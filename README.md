## :pushpin: **Reminders**

- All deliveries must be made in github.com repositories and a repository must be created for each exercise.
- Create the default repositories in the main branch and only work in that branch.
- Import the repository, the main branch to codesandbox.com
- Each repository must follow a nomenclature associated with the course, module and exercise. For example, for the useState and useEffect task, from module 2, the name of the repository will be:

***ra-m2-usestate-useeffect***

- Repositories not properly named will not be considered, and a name change will be requested. The name change will not be considered a revision
